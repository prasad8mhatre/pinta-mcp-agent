 draw rectangle in middle of 200 x 200 and add a text inside rectangle as "prasad"

  What should I do next?
response:
 Okay, I need to figure out how to draw a rectangle in the middle of a 200x200 image and then add the text "prasad" inside it. Here's the plan:

1.  **Open Pinta:** I need to open the Pinta image editor first.
2.  **Set Image Size:**  I'll create or resize the image to be 200x200. (I don't have a tool to directly set image size, but I can assume Pinta opens with a default size and work within that for this problem. If the default size is significantly different, the rectangle won't be truly centered).
3.  **Calculate Rectangle Coordinates:** I'll calculate the coordinates for the rectangle so that it appears roughly in the center. A rectangle with sides of length 50 would be a reasonable size. To center this inside 200x200 the top left corner would start at about (75, 75). And the bottom right would be about (125, 125).
4.  **Draw Rectangle:** Use the `draw_rectangle` tool to draw the rectangle.
5.  **Calculate Text Coordinates:** Determine the coordinates to place the text "prasad" roughly in the center of the rectangle.
6.  **Add Text:** Use the `add_text` tool to add the text.
7.  **Save Image:** Save the final image.

Now, let's execute the plan.

**Step 1: Open Pinta**

response:
 First, I need to find the center of the Pinta window to draw the rectangle. Then, I'll determine the coordinates for a 200x200 rectangle centered around that point. Finally, I'll add the text "prasad" inside the rectangle.

TOOL: get_screen_size()

Called open_pinta with {}, got: [true] Called get_screen_size with {}, got: [(1920, 1080)]  What should I do next?
response:
 I need to calculate the coordinates for the rectangle and the text.
The screen size is (1920, 1080). The rectangle size is 200x200, so I need to find the center coordinates for both.

Rectangle:
Center x = 1920 / 2 = 960
Center y = 1080 / 2 = 540
Top-left x = 960 - 100 = 860
Top-left y = 540 - 100 = 440
Bottom-right x = 960 + 100 = 1060
Bottom-right y = 540 + 100 = 640

Text:
Center x = 960
Center y = 540

Now I can draw the rectangle and add the text.

TOOL: draw_rectangle(x1=860, y1=440, x2=1060, y2=640, is_square=True)

response:
 The previous actions have successfully opened Pinta, retrieved the screen size, and drawn a square rectangle of size 200x200. Now, the next step is to add the text "prasad" inside the rectangle. To do this, I need to choose appropriate coordinates for the text to be centered within the rectangle. The rectangle's top-left corner is at (860, 440) and its bottom-right corner is at (1060, 640). Therefore, the center of the rectangle is roughly at ((860+1060)/2, (440+640)/2) = (960, 540). I'll use these coordinates as a starting point and adjust if necessary.
